# React TypeScript Boilerplate with Tailwind CSS

This repository provides a boilerplate for quickly starting development of a React application using TypeScript and Tailwind CSS based on Vite powerful rendering engine.

## Features

- React 16.x
- TypeScript 4.x
- Tailwind CSS 2.x

## Getting Started

To get started with this boilerplate, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/blacksamouraii/super_react_tailwindcss_boilerplate.git
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run start
```

This will start a development server and open the application in your default browser. Any changes you make to the code will be automatically reflected in the browser.

## Build and Deployment

To build the production version of the application, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a production-ready build of the application in the build directory. You can then deploy this build to any static file host.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the project to fit your needs. You can change the design by modifying the Tailwind CSS configuration in tailwind.config.js, or add additional functionality by modifying the React components in the src directory.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
